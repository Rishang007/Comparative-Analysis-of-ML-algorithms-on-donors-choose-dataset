 DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.

## In this project, I use various machine learning techniques to create a model which predicts whether the project submitted by the teacher will get approved or not.

I start by preprocessing the data. The text data is preprocessed to a form suitable for our ml algorithms. Then I  apply vectorization techniques like  bag of words, tfidf, w2v etc to create a final dataset ready to be fit into our ML Algorithms.

### The ML algorithms used are Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours.
